# Deep Learning Model

This is a deep learning model for predicting the sum of two random four-digit numbers.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-learning-model.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install numpy matplotlib

3. Run the code:
python main.py

File Structure
main.py: The main script for training and evaluating the deep learning model.
model.py: Contains the implementation of the deep learning model.
utils.py: Contains utility functions for data preprocessing and visualization.
data.csv: Dataset file containing the generated training data.
Results
The model is trained for 1000 iterations, and the training loss is plotted during the training process.
